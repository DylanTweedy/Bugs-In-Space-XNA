Make Rectangle lists for each type of tile sheet and then a way to select the correct sheet.
Change hills to start flat and then created by the creators. (Need a method for this.)
Once every frame cycle through every chunk on screen and apply updates and calculate render states.
(ie. Do most of the pre-draw work and scan blocks adjacent tiles, act accordingly)
Then do this for at least one other random active chunk (so other chunks are updated whilst you're not there.)
Add the stone probability tables.
Bring back the active blocks:
Decaying and Healing are now bools, if a block is below half health for a certain amount of time it becomes decaying, otherwise, healing.
Add a form of ActiveBlock for moving blocks (ie. replace falling blocks with this, but also could be used for explosions.)
remove block details outside of render area.
Try combining rocks (ie. Basaltic Trachyandesite can be a combination of the two rocks layered)

block deccorations can be done per block type, rather than per block.
every block decorations could also be based on certain conditions such and temperature and pressure. i.e. ice decor/ lava decor.
